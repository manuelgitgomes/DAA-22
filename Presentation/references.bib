title={Continuous stereo camera calibration in urban scenarios},
year={2017},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-6},
abstract={The quality of a 3D reconstruction obtained from stereo images depends on the accuracy of the stereo camera calibration. Continuous online camera calibration is key to enable a long maintenance-free operation of autonomous vehicles. Conventional algorithms for online calibration usually assume a static world. This, however, is often violated in urban scenarios. In this paper an algorithm is presented that determines the twelve degrees-of-freedom (12-DoF) extrinsic calibration of a stereo camera system in dynamic, urban scenarios. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) continuously estimates the extrinsic stereo camera calibration by tracking the position of salient points in 3D space that are observed in both cameras. The EKF predicts the 3D position of tracked points based on the estimated calibration and the vehicle's motion, which is estimated using an inertial navigation system (INS) and odometry sensors. However, only static points can be reliable predicted. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to segment camera images on a pixel level. These segmented images are further converted to binary images labelling static and potentially dynamic pixels. Only salient points which are labeled as static are retained for estimation of the stereo camera calibration. While the stereo camera's extrinsic parameters are only observable under transformation and two independent rotations of the vehicle, we present a robust filter update scheme, that enables estimation of the 12-DoF extrinsic stereo camera calibration even in the absence of significant rotations. Test on urban roads show that minor road imperfections are sufficient to estimate all 12-DoF extrinsic parameters over time.},

abstract={The rectification process is a compulsory step in stereo matching computation. To obtain depth information, stereo camera systems are often installed in vehicles for outdoor and street-related applications, including vehicle and pedestrian detection, lane detection, and traffic sign recognition. In this paper, we propose a rectification method that uses currently available front- and rear-view vehicle cameras to produce rectified stereo images. The proposed method can be employed with different types of cameras that have varying focal lengths. In addition, this method tolerates the problem of camera alignment variation from normal stereo camera systems. To achieve this, a compensation method for different focal lengths and the estimation of image relationships are introduced. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can operate robustly and accurately with different kinds of stereo images and significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art rectification method.},

abstract={Stereo cameras and dense stereo matching algorithms are core components for many robotic applications due to their abilities to directly obtain dense depth measurements and their robustness against changes in lighting conditions. However, the performance of dense depth estimation relies heavily on accurate stereo extrinsic calibration. In this work, we present a real-time markerless approach for obtaining high-precision stereo extrinsic calibration using a novel 5-DOF (degrees-of-freedom) and nonlinear optimization on a manifold, which captures the observability property of vision-only stereo calibration. Our method minimizes epipolar errors between spatial per-frame sparse natural features. It does not require temporal feature correspondences, making it not only invariant to dynamic scenes and illumination changes, but also able to run significantly faster than standard bundle adjustment-based approaches. We introduce a principled method to determine if the calibration converges to the required level of accuracy, and show through online experiments that our approach achieves a level of accuracy that is comparable to offline marker-based calibration methods. Our method refines stereo extrinsic to the accuracy that is sufficient for block matching-based dense disparity computation. It provides a cost-effective way to improve the reliability of stereo vision systems for long-term autonomy.},

abstract={RGBD cameras provide color and depth images at a high speed, so they are becoming increasingly important in many computer vision applications. With the color and depth information, it is easy to build a textured 3D model of a scene without effort on correspondence search. To combine depth data from multiple RGBD cameras in a unified coordinate system, the cameras need to be extrinsically calibrated based on 3D correspondences of scene features. To maximize the scene features simultaneously observed from different viewpoints, a spherical calibration object is widely used. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically detecting a spherical object in an RGB image. Since the detection relies only on RGB information, the proposed method has a potential to be extended to conventional multi-view calibration. Experimental results show that the proposed method accurately detects spherical objects in a cluttered environment.},

abstract={This paper presents a new depth-based hand-eye calibration method to find the transformation between depth camera and robot wrist. Owing to the true hand-eye transformation is hard to obtained, indirect measurements depending on robot movements and calibration tools is adopted. In our method, A sphere, which has simple and elegant parameterized presentation, is used as calibration tool. The points cloud acquired from the depth camera viewing the calibration tool are aligned to a virtual sphere model by RANSAC to find the translation part of the homogeneous transformation between depth camera and calibration tool. The rotational part of the transformation is ambiguous thus eliminated by reformulating the hand-eye calibration problem. Then a non-linear optimization method is proposed to solve the hand-eye rotation and translation simultaneously. Due to the ground truth hand-eye transformation is not available, a quantitative error measurement is adopted to measure the accuracy.},

abstract={Color-depth cameras (RGB-D cameras) have become the primary sensors in most robotics systems, from service robotics to industrial robotics applications. Typical consumer-grade RGB-D cameras are provided with a coarse intrinsic and extrinsic calibration that generally does not meet the accuracy requirements needed by many robotics applications [e.g., highly accurate three-dimensional (3-D) environment reconstruction and mapping, high precision object recognition, localization, etc.]. In this paper, we propose a human-friendly, reliable, and accurate calibration framework that enables to easily estimate both the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a general color-depth sensor couple. Our approach is based on a novel two components error model. This model unifies the error sources of RGB-D pairs based on different technologies, such as structured-light 3-D cameras and time-of-flight cameras. Our method provides some important advantages compared to other state-of-the-art systems: It is general (i.e., well suited for different types of sensors), based on an easy and stable calibration protocol, provides a greater calibration accuracy, and has been implemented within the robot operating system robotics framework. We report detailed experimental validations and performance comparisons to support our statements.},

abstract={Commodity depth cameras have created many interesting new applications in the research community recently. These applications often require the calibration information between the color and the depth cameras. Traditional checkerboard based calibration schemes fail to work well for the depth camera, since its corner features cannot be reliably detected in the depth image. In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood solution for the joint depth and color calibration based on two principles. First, in the depth image, points on the checker board shall be co-planar, and the plane is known from color camera calibration. Second, additional point correspondences between the depth and color images may be manually specified or automatically established to help improve calibration accuracy. Uncertainty in depth values has been taken into account systematically. The proposed algorithm is reliable and accurate, as demonstrated by extensive experimental results on jimulated and real-world examples.},

abstract={In recent years, more and more robots have been equipped with low-cost RGB-D sensors, such as Microsoft Kinect and Intel Realsense, for safe navigation and active interaction with objects and people. In order to obtain more accurate and reliable fused color and depth information (coloured point clouds), not only the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of color and depth sensor should be precisely calibrated but also the external corrections of depth measurements are required. In this paper, using motion capture system, we propose a reliable calibration framework that enables the precise estimation of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of RGB-D sensors and provide a model-free depth calibration method based on heteroscedastic Gaussian processes. Compared with the existing depth correction techniques, our method can simultaneously estimate the mean and variance of the depth error at different measurement distances, i.e., the probability distribution of the depth error relative to the measured distance, which is essential in the state estimation problems. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a thorough qualitative and quantitative analysis of the major steps of our calibration method, and compare our experimental results with other related work. Furthermore, we demonstrate an experiment about the overall improvement of visual SLAM with a Kinect device calibrated by our calibration technique.},

abstract={With growing demands for accuracy in sensor fusion, increasing attention is being paid to temporal offsets as a source of deterministic error when processing data from multiple devices. Established approaches for the calibration of temporal offsets exploit domain-specific heuristics of common sensor suites and utilize simplifications to circumvent some of the challenges arising when both temporal and spatial parameters are not accurately known a priori. These properties make it difficult to generalize the work to other applications or different combinations of sensors. This work presents a general and principled approach to joint estimation of temporal offsets and spatial transformations between sensors. Our framework exploits recent advances in continuous-time batch estimation and thus exists within the rigorous theoretical framework of maximum likelihood estimation. The derivation is presented without relying on unique properties of specific sensors and, therefore, represents the first general technique for temporal calibration in robotics. The broad applicability of this approach is demonstrated through spatiotemporal calibration of a camera with respect to an inertial measurement unit as well as between a stereo camera and a laser range finder. The method is shown to be more repeatable and accurate than the current state of the art, estimating spatial displacements to millimeter precision and temporal offsets to a fraction of the fastest measurement interval.},

abstract={Camera calibration applications are used in many places, such as visual estimation, 3D reconstruction and object tracking. Over the past few decades, many methods have been proposed and applied to these areas. However, with the diversification of sensor technology, the problem of multi-sensor joint calibration becomes more and more obvious. In this paper, we propose a new method that can simultaneously calibrate relative poses of three external cameras and a Kinect. And the final cost function is optimized for joint calibration. In addition, the practical platform has also tested the method, and the experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed method significantly improved.},

abstract={The technique of multi-sensor fusion has already been used widely in intelligent vehicle environment perception. The spatial calibration of the radar and camera is the basis for road detection with information fusion real-timely. So, a method of spatial calibration of radar and the camera has been proposed to implement the spatial calibration of the two sensors. The non-linear distortion of the camera is considered in the paper. Coordinate transformation between the coordinates relevant to the radar and camera is introduced as the constraints. After transforming the feature between the related coordinates of image and the relative coordinates of radar, the calibration parameters are determined with the least square error function. Experiment results indicate that this method is simple and easy to realize, which has the high accuracy that satisfy requirement of the system.},

Different methods for calibrating Lidar sensor and RGB cameras have been proposed using special 3D markers or calibration patterns. However, most of these methods have disadvantages of longer processing time, and various experimental constraints such as entire calibration pattern must appear within the scan range of the Lidar. In this paper, we propose a simple and fast calibration method between a Lidar sensor and multiple RGB cameras using a sphere object.},

Willow Garage announced in May the 11 institutions that will get to use a PR2 for free for two years through its PR2 Beta Program (Figure 1). The PR2s all run ROS, and the institutions have all committed to making significant open-source contributions back to the ROS community. ROS has been gaining traction at an astonishing rate since its release in January, but having 11 PR2s at top institutions will accelerate that progress even further. We will give a brief overview of what the PR2 Beta Program recipients are planning to do, and then dive into a concrete example of the use of ROS on the PR2.},

abstract={Many calibration methods calibrate a pair of sensors at a time. For robotic systems with many sensors, they are often time-consuming to use, and can also lead to inaccurate results. In this paper, we combine a number of ideas in the literature to derive a unified framework that jointly calibrates many sensors a large system. Key to our approach are (i) grouping sensors to produce 3D data, thereby providing a unifying formalism that allows us to jointly calibrate all of the groups at the same, (ii) using a variety of geometric constraints to perform the calibration, and (iii) sharing sensors between groups to increase robustness. We show that this gives a simple method that is easily applicable to calibrating large systems. Our experiments show that this method not only reduces calibration error, but also requires less human time.},

abstract={The tf library was designed to provide a standard way to keep track of coordinate frames and transform data within an entire system such that individual component users can be confident that the data is in the coordinate frame that they want without requiring knowledge of all the coordinate frames in the system. During early development of the Robot Operating System (ROS), keeping track of coordinate frames was identified as a common pain point for developers. The complexity of this task made it a common place for bugs when developers improperly applied transforms to data. The problem is also a challenge due to the often distributed sources of information about transformations between different sets of coordinate frames. This paper will explain the complexity of the problem and distill the requirements. Then it will discuss the design of the tf library in relation to the requirements. A few use cases will be presented to demonstrate successful deployment of the library. And powerful extensions to the core capabilities such as being able to transform data in time as well as in space.},

The architecture of the autonomy system of self-driving cars is typically organized into the perception system and the decision-making system. The perception system is generally divided into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as self-driving-car localization, static obstacles mapping, moving obstacles detection and tracking, road mapping, traffic signalization detection and recognition, among others.

We explore the use of Conjugate Gradients for calculating the Newton step and its performance as a function of some simple and computationally efficient preconditioners. We show that the common Schur complement trick is not limited to factorization-based methods and that it can be interpreted as a form of preconditioning. Using photos from a street-side dataset and several community photo collections, we generate a variety of bundle adjustment problems and use them to evaluate the performance of six different bundle adjustment algorithms. Our experiments show that truncated Newton methods, when paired with relatively simple preconditioners, offer state of the art performance for large-scale bundle adjustment.

The problem becomes even more difficult to handle, when the data are collected using multiple sensors. Realizing the ability of fuzzy sets to deal with imprecision and uncertainty, a multi-sensors data fusion technique was developed in this study by using fuzzy clustering and predictive tools. The data were first clustered based on their similarity using an entropy-based fuzzy C-means clustering technique and the obtained clusters were utilized to develop a fuzzy reasoning-based predictive tool. The novelty of this study lies with the application of a clustering algorithm, which can ensure both compactness and distinctness of the developed clusters, and development of a reasoning tool utilizing the information of obtained clusters. Two types of multi-sensors data were used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results were compared with those available in the literature, and the developed technique was found to perform better than the previous approaches on both the data sets. The better performance of the proposed algorithm could be due to its in-depth search of the data set through similarity-based fuzzy clustering followed by the development of fuzzy reasoning tool utilizing the information of obtained clusters."

Recently, distributed data association methods that involve only local information processing on each camera node and mutual information exchanging between neighboring cameras have attracted many research interests due to their superiority in large scale applications. In this paper, we propose a new method that performs global data association in a distributed manner by fusing the appearance and spatio-temporal measurements of objects captured by all camera nodes in the entire network. Specifically, we formulate the data association problem in smart camera networks as an Integer Programming problem by introducing a set of linking variables, and propose two distributed algorithms, namely L-DD and Q-DD, to solve the Integer Programming problem using the dual decomposition technique. In our algorithms, the original Integer Programming problem is decomposed into several subproblems, which can be solved locally on each smart camera. Different subproblems reach consensus on their solutions in a rigorous way by adjusting their parameters iteratively based on the projected subgradient optimization. The proposed method is simple and flexible, in that (i) we can incorporate any feature extraction and matching technique into our framework to calculate the similarity between observations, which corresponds to the costs of links in our model, and (ii) we can decompose the original problem in any way as long as the resulting subproblem can be solved independently and efficiently. We show the competitiveness of our method in both accuracy and speed by theoretical analysis and experimental comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms."

A parallel 2D/3D-camera is a hardware setup of a range camera and a high-resolution gray-value camera spatially related to each other by a fixed translation. The proposed calibration algorithm utilizes the fact that for known calibration patterns the range reconstruction accuracy of the gray-value camera is significantly higher than that of the range sensor. Using the calibrated 2D/3D-camera we identify the range pixels within the gray-value image for each pair of acquired camera images. We present three low-level data fusion approaches assigning range information to each gray-value pixel based on different neighborhood relations to the identified range pixels: one-nearest neighbor, nearest neighbors in the surrounding Delaunay-triangle, and nearest neighbors constrained by a gray-value image segmentation. We demonstrate the applicability, efficiency and accuracy of our calibration and fusion algorithms on real and synthetic data. Our real experiments are performed on a 2D/3D-camera comprising a Siemens 64×8-pixel time-of-flight range camera developed within the European project PReVENT (UseRCams) and a common gray-value camera."

The filter tracks the features through the data sequences and estimates the 3D position and affines motion parameters. The originality of this work relies on a 3D modelling of this problem to jointly estimate the 3D structure and motion. This estimation is made possible by the use of an active sensor (range camera)."

However, developing a generic framework with high generalization capability that can effectively fuse diverse datasets is a challenging task since the current approaches are usually only applicable to two specific sensors for data fusion. In this paper, we propose an accurate fusion-based technique called SubFus with capability to integrate diverse remote sensing data for land cover classification. Here, we assume that a high dimensional multisensor dataset can be represented fused features that live in a lower-dimensional space. The proposed classification methodology includes three main stages. First, spatial information is extracted by using spatial filters (i.e., morphology filters). Then, a novel low-rank minimization problem is proposed to represent the multisensor datasets in subspaces using fused features. The fused features in the lower-dimensional subspace are estimated using a novel iterative algorithm based on the alternative direction method of multipliers. Third, the final classification map is produced by applying a supervised spectral classifier (i.e., random forest) on the fused features. In the experiments, the proposed method is applied to a three-sensor (RGB, multispectral LiDAR, and hyperspectral images) dataset captured over the area of the University of Houston, the USA, and a two-sensor (hyperspectral and LiDAR) dataset captured over the city of Trento, Italy. The land-cover maps generated using SubFus are evaluated based on classification accuracies. Experimental results obtained by SubFus confirm considerable improvements in terms of classification accuracies compared with the other methods used in the experiments. The proposed fusion approach obtains 85.32% and 99.25% in terms of overall classification accuracy on the Houston (the training portion of the dataset distributed for the data fusion contest of 2018) and trento datasets, respectively."

In addition to documenting a number of large loop closures useful for developing mapping and localization algorithms, this data set also records the first robotic traffic jam and two autonomous vehicle collisions.

abstract = {Machine tool owners require knowledge of their machine’s capabilities, and the emphasis increases with areas of high accuracy manufacturing. An aspect of a machine’s capability is its geometric accuracy. International Standards and best-practice guides are available to aid understanding of the required measurements and to advise on how to perform them. However, there is an absence of any intelligent method capable of optimising the duration of a calibration plan, minimising machine down-time. In this work, artificial intelligence in the form of automated planning is applied to the problem of machine tool pseudo-static geometric error calibration. No prior knowledge of Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning is required throughout this paper. The authors have written this paper for calibration engineers to see the benefits that automated planning can provide. Two models are proposed; the first produces a sequential calibration plan capable of finding the optimal calibration plan. The second model has the additional possibility of planning for concurrent measurements, adding the possibility of further reducing machine down-time. Both models take input regarding a machine’s configuration and available instrumentation. The efficacy of both models is evaluated by performing a case study of a five-axis gantry machine, whereby calibration plans are produced and compared against both an academic and industrial expert. From this, the effectiveness of this novel method for producing optimal calibration plan is evaluated, stimulating potential for future work.}

In special, the problem of mapping complex environments, with features changing from tree-lined streets to urban areas with dense traffic, is studied. The robotic car is equipped with an odometry sensor, a 3D LiDAR Velodyne HDL-32E, a IMU, and a low cost GPS, and the data generated by these sensors are integrated in a pose-based GraphSLAM estimator. A new strategy for identification and correction of odometry data using evolutionary algorithms is presented. This new strategy makes odometry data significantly more consistent with GPS. Loop closures are detected using GPS data, and GICP, a 3D point cloud registration algorithm, is used to estimate the displacement between the different travels over the same region. After path estimation, 3D LiDAR data is used to build an occupancy grid mapping of the environment. A detailed mathematical description of how occupancy evidence can be calculated from the point clouds is given, and a submapping strategy to handle memory limitations is presented as well. The proposed framework is tested in three real world environments with different sizes, and features: a parking lot, a university beltway, and a city neighborhood. In all cases, satisfactory maps were built, with precise loop closures even when the vehicle traveled long distances between them.}

In general, semantic 3D mapping is mainly composed of 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation. As these technologies evolve, there has been great progress in semantic 3D mapping in recent years. Furthermore, the number of robotic applications requiring semantic information in 3D mapping to perform high-level tasks has increased, and many studies on semantic 3D mapping have been published. Existing methods use a camera for both 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation. However, this is not suitable for large-scale environments and has the disadvantage of high computational complexity. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal sensor-based semantic 3D mapping system using a 3D Lidar combined with a camera. In this study, the odometry is obtained by high-precision global positioning system (GPS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU), and it is estimated by iterative closest point (ICP) when a GPS signal is weak. Then, we use the latest 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. To build a semantic 3D map, we integrate the 3D map with semantic information by using coordinate transformation and Bayes’ update scheme. In order to improve the semantic 3D map, we propose a 3D refinement process to correct wrongly segmented voxels and remove traces of moving vehicles in the 3D map. Through experiments on challenging sequences, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and intersection over union (IoU). Thus, our method can be used for various applications that require semantic information in 3D map.}

abstract = {An intelligent vehicle must identify the exact position and class of the surrounding object in various situations to consider the interaction with them. For this reason, the light detection and range sensor, called LiDAR, is widely used in intelligent vehicles. The LiDAR provides information in the form of a point cloud that can be used to localize and classify the surrounding objects. However, unlike vision-based object detection and classification system, the LiDAR-based recognition system cannot provide sufficient classification performance even with deep learning technologies. The reason is that the LiDAR point cloud does not have enough shape information to classify the dynamic object due to the sparsity of the points. To address this problem, we proposed a framework to enhance the deep learning-based classification performance by augmenting the shape information of the LiDAR point cloud. The augmented shape information not only improves classification performance of the networks, but also allows deep learning networks to train effectively by using artificial data-set which is generated with 3D computer-aided design model without tedious efforts of labeling. In order to enhance this shape information effectively, also, this paper proposes a layer-based accumulation algorithm considering the three degree-of-freedom motion of a dynamic object. In the experimental results, the proposed accumulation method outperformed existing registration-based methods. In real-vehicle data test, moreover, the deep learning networks trained with artificial data showed better performance when the LiDAR point cloud was accumulated.}

With the success of deep learning methods in the field of computer vision, researchers have made a great effort to transfer their superior performance to the field of remote sensing image analysis. This paper starts with a summary of the fundamental deep neural network architectures and reviews the most recent developments of deep learning methods for semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery including non-conventional data such as hyperspectral images and point clouds. In our review of the literature, we identified three major challenges faced by researchers and summarize the innovative development to address them. As tremendous efforts have been devoted to advancing pixel-level accuracy, the emerged deep learning methods demonstrated much-improved performance on several public data sets. As to handling the non-conventional, unstructured point cloud and rich spectral imagery, the performance of the state-of-the-art methods is, on average, inferior to that of the satellite imagery. Such a performance gap also exists in learning from small data sets. In particular, the limited non-conventional remote sensing data sets with labels is an obstacle to developing and evaluating new deep learning methods.}

abstract = {In the past few decades, many results have been achieved in the research of mobile robot path planning, and they have been applied in simple scenarios, such as factory AGV, bank guide robot. However, path planning in highly dense and complex scenarios has become an important challenge for applications. Robots face dense map and complex obstacles and hardly find out an optimal path within a reasonable period, such as unmanned vehicles in freight ports and rescue robots in earthquake environment. Therefore, a multi-obstacle path planning and optimization method is proposed. In order to simplify complex environmental obstacles, the obstacles will be divided into basis obstacles and extension obstacles. Firstly, the basis obstacles and their contour point sets are determined according to the starting point and goal point. Furthermore, the basis obstacles are optimized by convex hulls, and then the corresponding basis point set is obtained. Secondly, the extension obstacles are determined by the basis point set, starting point and goal point, and then the corresponding extension point set is generated. After that, a path planner is designed by the multi-objective D* Lite algorithm for distance and smoothness in order to get reasonable and optimized path in a complex environment. Moreover, the path is smoothed by cubic bezier curves to fit the kinematic model of the robot. Finally, The proposed method conduct comparative experiments with other algorithms to verify its accuracy and computational efficiency of planning in complex environments.}

abstract = {The fusion of data from different sensors often requires that an accurate geometric transformation between the sensors is known. The procedure by which these transformations are estimated is known as sensor calibration. The vast majority of calibration approaches focus on specific pairwise combinations of sensor modalities, unsuitable to calibrate robotic systems containing multiple sensors of varied modalities. This paper presents a novel calibration methodology which is applicable to multi-sensor, multi-modal robotic systems. The approach formulates the calibration as an extended optimization problem, in which the poses of the calibration patterns are also estimated. It makes use of a topological representation of the coordinates frames in the system, in order to recalculate the poses of the sensors throughout the optimization. Sensor poses are retrieved from the combination of geometric transformations which are atomic, in the sense that they are indivisible. As such, we refer to this approach as ATOM - Atomic Transformations Optimization Method. This makes the approach applicable to different calibration problems, such as sensor to sensor, sensor in motion, or sensor to coordinate frame. Additionally, the proposed approach provides advanced functionalities, integrated into ROS, designed to support the several stages of a complete calibration procedure. Results covering several robotic platforms and a large spectrum of calibration problems show that the methodology is in fact general, and achieves calibrations which are as accurate as the ones provided by state of the art methods designed to operate only for specific combinations of pairwise modalities.}

We present a novel category-level approach that correctly accommodates object instances previously unseen during training. We introduce Articulation-aware Normalized Coordinate Space Hierarchy (ANCSH) - a canonical representation for different articulated objects in a given category. As the key to achieve intra-category generalization, the representation constructs a canonical object space as well as a set of canonical part spaces. The canonical object space normalizes the object orientation, scales and articulations (e.g. joint parameters and states) while each canonical part space further normalizes its part pose and scale. We develop a deep network based on PointNet++ that predicts ANCSH from a single depth point cloud, including part segmentation, normalized coordinates, and joint parameters in the canonical object space. By leveraging the canonicalized joints, we demonstrate: 1) improved performance in part pose and scale estimations using the induced kinematic constraints from joints; 2) high accuracy for joint parameter estimation in camera space.},

  %  abstract = {Human life is populated with articulated objects. Current Category-level Articulation Pose Estimation (CAPE) methods are studied under the single-instance setting with a fixed kinematic structure for each category. Considering these limitations, we aim to study the problem of estimating part-level 6D pose for multiple articulated objects with unknown kinematic structures in a single RGB-D image, and reform this problem setting for real-world environments and suggest a CAPE-Real (CAPER) task setting. This setting allows varied kinematic structures within a semantic category, and multiple instances to co-exist in an observation of real world. To support this task, we build an articulated model repository ReArt-48 and present an efficient dataset generation pipeline, which contains Fast Articulated Object Modeling (FAOM) and Semi-Authentic MixEd Reality Technique (SAMERT). Accompanying the pipeline, we build a large-scale mixed reality dataset ReArtMix and a real world dataset ReArtVal. Accompanying the CAPER problem and the dataset, we propose an effective framework that exploits RGB-D input to estimate part-level pose for multiple instances in a single forward pass. In our method, we introduce object detection from RGB-D input to handle the multi-instance problem and segment each instance into several parts. To address the unknown kinematic structure issue, we propose an Articulation Parsing Network to analyze the structure of detected instance, and also build a Pair Articulation Pose Estimation module to estimate per-part 6D pose as well as joint property from connected part pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve good performance on CAPER, CAPE and instance-level Robot Arm pose estimation problems. We believe it could serve as a strong baseline for future research on the CAPER task. The datasets and codes in our work will be made publicly available.},

  %  abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of one shot pose estimation of articulated ob-jects from an RGB-D image. In particular, we consider object instances with the topol-ogy of a kinematic chain, i.e. assemblies of rigid parts connected by prismatic or revolute joints. This object type occurs often in daily live, for instance in the form of furniture or electronic devices. Instead of treating each object part separately we are using the rela-tionship between parts of the kinematic chain and propose a new minimal pose sampling approach. This enables us to create a pose hypothesis for a kinematic chain consist-ing of K parts by sampling K 3D-3D point correspondences. To asses the quality of our method, we gathered a large dataset containing four objects and 7000+ annotated RGB-D frames 1 . On this dataset we achieve considerably better results than a modified state-of-the-art pose estimation system for rigid objects.},

  %  abstract = {<p>Robots operating in domestic environments generally need to interact with articulated objects, such as doors, cabinets, dishwashers or fridges. In this work, we present a novel, probabilistic framework for modeling articulated objects as kinematic graphs. Vertices in this graph correspond to object parts, while edges between them model their kinematic relationship. In particular, we present a set of parametric and non-parametric edge models and how they can robustly be estimated from noisy pose observations. We furthermore describe how to estimate the kinematic structure and how to use the learned kinematic models for pose prediction and for robotic manipulation tasks. We finally present how the learned models can be generalized to new and previously unseen objects. In various experiments using real robots with different camera systems as well as in simulation, we show that our approach is valid, accurate and efficient. Further, we demonstrate that our approach has a broad set of applications, in particular for the emerging fields of mobile manipulation and service robotics.</p>},

  %  abstract = {We present a skill for the perception of three-dimensional kinematic structures of rigid articulated bodies with revolute and prismatic joints. The ability to acquire such models autonomously is required for general manipulation in unstructured environments. Experiments on a mobile manipulation platform with real-world objects under varying lighting conditions demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. This robustness is achieved by integrating perception and manipulation capabilities: the manipulator interacts with the environment to move an unknown object, thereby creating a perceptual signal that reveals the kinematic properties of the object. For good performance, the perceptual skill requires the presence of trackable visual features in the scene.},

The systems rely on a RGB-D stream, contact wrenches, and proprioception. The proposed systems share an algorithmic foundation: they are based on an architecture of coupled recursive estimation processes. We present and advocate this architecture as a general, versatile, and robust solution for online interactive perception problems. We validate the architecture in extensive experiments to extract kinematic models interactively, varying the appearance, size, structure, and dynamic properties of objects for different tasks and under different environmental conditions. In addition, we experimentally show that the information acquired by the online perception systems enables robot manipulation of articulated objects. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between the proposed architecture for robot perception and insights about biological perception systems.},

The presented method provides a probabilistic model that integrates visual observations with feedback from manipulation actions to best characterize a distribution of possible articulation models. We evaluate several action selection methods to efficiently reduce the uncertainty about the articulation model. The full system is experimentally evaluated using a PR2 mobile manipulator. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed system allows for intelligent reasoning about sparse, noisy data in a number of common manipulation scenarios.},

abstract = {Author identification based on heterogeneous bibliographic networks, which is to identify potential authors given an anonymous paper, has been studied in recent years. However, most of the existing works merely consider the relationship between authors and anonymous papers, while ignore the relationships between authors. In this paper, we take the relationships among authors into consideration to study the problem of author set identification, which is to identify an author set rather than an individual author related to an anonymous paper. The proposed problem has important applications to new collaborator discovery and group building. We propose a novel Author Set Identification approach, namely ASI. ASI first extracts a task-guided embedding to learn the low-dimensional representations of nodes in bibliographic network. And then ASI leverages the learned embedding to construct a weighted paper-ego-network, which contains anonymous paper and candidate authors. Finally, converting the optimal author set identification to the quasi-clique discovery in the constructed network, ASI utilizes a local-search heuristic mechanism under the guidance of the devised density function to find the optimal quasiclique. Extensive experiments on bibliographic networks demonstrate that ASI outperforms the state-of-art baselines in author set identification.},
